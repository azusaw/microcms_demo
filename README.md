# what is microCMS?

API-based headless made in Japan.

It's under active development and adding more and more great features.

Very very easy to use.
I feel that there is nothing you can't do with microCMS :heart:


# build setup
```
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# export to out directory
$ npm run export
```

# for local
Create `.env.development` and set parameters of microCMS.
```.env.development
X_API_KEY=hogehoge
```
